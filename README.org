* EmbArBB
  + Embedded language for data parallel programming targetting Intel ArBB. 
  + Uses the Haskell/ArBB bindings (svenssonjoel/arbb-vm.git on github)

* Status
  + The samples and benchmarks now run again 
    
* TODOs:  
  + huge cleanup is needed.
   
  + Things like mkScalar needs to be separated from the specific backend. 
    
  + DONE: separate Reification and code generation somehow.
          the interface between front and back is now encapsulated 
          in something called a GenRecord.
