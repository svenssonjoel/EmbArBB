* EmbArBB 
  + Embedded language for data-parallel programming targetting Intel ArBB.
  + very sketchy! (But improving) 
  + Uses the Haskell/ArBB bindings (svenssonjoel/arbb-vm.git on github) 

* Status 
  + Generates ArBB functions from functions in the embedded language. 

* TODOs 
  + Add functionality (cover as many as possible of the ops supported by ArBB) 
  + (PARTIALLY DONE): Figure out how to capture functions with many outputs. 
  + Figure out how to support functions with many outputs in a more robust way.
    
* Notes
  + ArBB Supplies the operations Rotate and RotateRev to the programmer. It seems 
    to me that RotateRev is compiled into a Rotate operation with a negated distance. 
  + Scan direction seems broken. Setting direction to 0 and 1 gives same resulting 
    output array (or did i missunderstand what the direction is supposed to mean).
