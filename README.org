* EmbArBB
  + Start repurposing EmbArBB for other code generators.  
    + Sequential C (Start here, proof of concept) 
    + Parallelism libraries 
    + OpenAcc 
    + OpenCL 
   
* TODOs 
  + Function reification needs improvement. 
  + Sharing detection, DAG conversion, Look over these. 
    + If keep: needs much change and improvement. 
    + If scrap: needs replacement by something. 
  + Map and Call were always broken (Environments are needed, Or
    free variables has to be captured at some point. Compile once 
    or compile many times...)
