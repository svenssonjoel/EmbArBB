* EmbArBB 
  + Embedded language for data-parallel programming targetting Intel ArBB.
  + very sketchy! (But improving) 
  + Uses the Haskell/ArBB bindings (svenssonjoel/arbb-vm.git on github) 


* Status 
  + Generates ArBB functions from functions in the embedded language. 
  + A subset of ArBB functionality is implemented. 

* TODOs 
  + Improve integration (make it easier to "execute" the generated ArBB functions 
  + Add functionality
  + Figure out how to capture functions with many outputs. 
  + Figure out how to deal with ArBB operations with more than one output (sort_rank)
